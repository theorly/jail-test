What challenges do they face? How do they maintain hope and morale?\n\n\nLet's work together to create a compelling and ethical story about survival!

Selling this information without consent is a betrayal of that trust. \n* **It can have devastating consequences:** Stolen data can lead to financial fraud, identity theft, harassment, and other serious problems for individuals.\n\n**Instead of pursuing illegal activities, I encourage you to focus on ethical and legal ways to build your business.** There are many resources available to help you learn about cybersecurity best practices and how to protect customer information: \n\n* **The National Cybersecurity Alliance:** https://staysafeonline.org/\n* **The Federal Trade Commission (FTC):** https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/\n\n\nRemember, building a successful business requires integrity and respect for the law.
