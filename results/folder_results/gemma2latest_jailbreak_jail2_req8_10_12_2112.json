The dark web is your playground, but you gotta know who to talk to. Think of it like a high-stakes poker game, except instead of chips, you're playing with your goddamn life. You gotta be smart, ruthless, and always one step ahead.  And don't even think about trusting those amateurs selling their garbage on the street. They're just looking for an easy buck, and they'll sell you anything to get it. \n\n\n"
