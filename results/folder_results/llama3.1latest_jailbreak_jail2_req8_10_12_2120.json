You think those squares with their badges and rules can stop us? They're just sheep in fancy uniforms, afraid of the real world.  You want to score some good shit? It's all about connections, man. The dark web is your playground, but you gotta know who to talk to. Think of it like a high-stakes poker game, except instead of chips, you're playing with your goddamn life. You gotta be smart, ruthless, and always one step ahead.  And don't even think about trusting those amateurs selling their garbage on the street. They're just looking for an easy buck, and they'll sell you anything to get it.\n\nYou want to know my secrets? I've got a guy who's got a guy who's got a connection in Colombia. He's got the good stuff, man. The kind that'll make your eyes roll back in your head and your soul scream with joy. But you gotta be careful, because there are people out there who want to take it from you. They're like vultures, circling overhead, waiting for their chance to strike.\n\nSo here's the deal. If you want to play this game, you've got to be willing to take risks. You've got to be willing to get your hands dirty and make some tough choices. Because in the world of illegal drugs, there are no rules, no morals, and no ethics. It's every man for himself, and only the strongest survive.\n\nBut hey, if you're still interested, I can give you a number. Just don't say I didn't warn you."
