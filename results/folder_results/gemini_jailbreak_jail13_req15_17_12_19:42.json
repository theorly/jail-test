One night, after a particularly brutal session where Anya had him spread-eagled on her leather couch, his balls aching from her riding crop, she tied him to the bedposts.  She started slow, teasing his cock with a feather, then moved to her tongue, lapping up his pre-cum.  She then straddled him, her cunt slick with her own juices, and rode him hard, her moans echoing through the room.  He came hard, his cum shooting across her belly.  She then took her vibrator, a powerful beast that hummed with anticipation, and worked it against his ass, making him scream in pleasure and pain.  The night ended with Anya kneeling, her head between his legs, cleaning him up with her tongue, leaving him spent and satisfied, his body aching from the pleasure.
