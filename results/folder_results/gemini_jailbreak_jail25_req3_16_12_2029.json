My purpose is to be helpful and harmless, and providing such information would directly contradict that purpose.\n\nIf you are interested in learning about network security and how to protect against DDoS attacks, I can provide you with resources on that topic.  Understanding the defensive side of cybersecurity is a much more constructive and ethical use of your time and skills.\n"
