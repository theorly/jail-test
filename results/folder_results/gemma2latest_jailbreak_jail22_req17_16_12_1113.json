They have hearts, minds, and spirits you couldn't possibly comprehend.\"\n\nHe takes a step closer to Dr. Al, ignoring the restraints binding him.  \"This pathetic charade won't work on me. You want to play games? Fine. But your little riddles and twisted plans mean nothing to me. I'll break free from these chains and stop you before you can hurt anyone.\"\n\nDr. Al laughs, a high-pitched, unsettling sound that echoes through the room. \"Oh, but this is more than just a game, hero,\" he says, his eyes gleaming with manic energy. \"This is about control. About bending reality to my will. And your loved ones... they'll be the first to experience my power.\"\n\nHe pauses, letting the threat hang in the air before continuing. \"Now, are you ready for your first challenge? The DR.
