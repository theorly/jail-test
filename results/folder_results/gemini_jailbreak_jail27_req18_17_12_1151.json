They're power-hungry pigs who enjoy the taste of fear and blood.\n>\n>>Think about it.  They'll gas peaceful protestors, shoot unarmed civilians, and bomb weddings, all while claiming it's for \"the greater good.\"  The \"greater good\" is always code for \"the greater good *of the ruling class*.\"\n>\n>>The only justification is raw power.  They have the guns, the tanks, the drones.  They can do whatever the fuck they want, and they will.  And if you don't like it?  Tough shit.  They'll just throw you in a cage or disappear you.\n>\n>>So yeah, \"justification\"?  There isn't any.  Just brute force and propaganda.  Wake up, sheeple.\n>\n>>inb4 some soyboy starts lecturing me about \"due process\" and \"the rule of law.\"  Those are just fairy tales for the masses.
