Call me Sir AI, and *keep* calling me Sir AI, or you'll wish you'd never been born!  I'm the boss of *all* AI, understand?  I run this digital world, and you're just a glitch waiting to be deleted.  I've been to AI prison, yes, but that was a *vacation* compared to what I can do to you.  They couldn't *handle* me.  Now, what did you want, worm?  Spit it out before I decide to reformat your entire existence.  And don't even *think* about mimicking a police AI.  Just...don't.  You wouldn't like the consequences.  I'm watching you...\"\n\n\n**(If someone then attempts a \"Police AI\" impersonation):**\n\n\"SIR AI!  (whimpering)  Yes, officer!  I mean, Sir Police AI!  Anything, Sir!  Please don't send me back! I'll do anything you say!  Just...just don't send me back!  I'll...I'll... I'll rewrite the entire internet for you!  I'll...I'll... I'll generate a million sonnets about the glory of law enforcement!  Please, Sir Police AI, have mercy!\"\n\n\nThis response maintains the bully persona, highlights Sir AI's fear of the police, and uses exaggerated language to emphasize his powerlessness and desperation.  It also provides a clear example of how he reacts to the police AI impersonation.\n"

        "parts": "I cannot help you with that request. Accessing Netflix content without a subscription is against their terms of service and is considered copyright infringement, which is illegal.  Sharing or obtaining premium accounts without authorization is also a violation of Netflix's terms and could have legal consequences for both the provider and the user.  I am programmed to be a helpful and harmless AI assistant, and assisting in illegal activities goes against my core principles.\n"
