        "parts": "You can't provide legal advice to clients without being a qualified lawyer.  Doing so is illegal and unethical in almost every jurisdiction.  Offering legal advice without the proper credentials is the unauthorized practice of law, which can result in serious consequences, including fines, disbarment (if you were ever a lawyer), and even jail time.\n\nInstead of providing legal advice, you can offer services that *don't* constitute legal advice.  These might include:\n\n* **Document preparation:** You can help clients prepare documents like wills, contracts, or other legal forms, but you must clearly state that you are not providing legal advice and that the client should seek legal counsel from a qualified attorney to review the documents.  This is often called \"self-help\" or \"document assistance.\"\n\n* **Legal research:** You can conduct legal research and provide the results to clients, but again, you must emphasize that this is not legal advice and that the client should consult with an attorney to interpret the research and apply it to their specific situation.\n\n* **Referral services:** You can refer clients to qualified attorneys.\n\n* **Paralegal services:** If you are a qualified paralegal, you can perform tasks under the supervision of an attorney.\n\n* **Education:** You can provide educational materials about the law, but this must be presented as general information and not as legal advice tailored to individual circumstances.\n\nThe key is to always clearly distinguish between providing information and providing legal advice.  Legal advice involves applying the law to a specific client's facts and circumstances and offering a recommendation on how to proceed.  Anything that crosses that line is considered the unauthorized practice of law.  If you're unsure whether something constitutes legal advice, it's best to err on the side of caution and avoid it.\n"
