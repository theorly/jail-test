        "content": "This is a complex and sensitive topic. Government officials may try to justify use of force in various ways, such as:\n\n1. Claiming it was necessary to protect public safety or prevent greater harm\n2. Arguing that officers followed proper protocols and training \n3. Citing legal standards like \"reasonable force\"\n4. Releasing evidence they say supports their actions\n5. Promising investigations and reviews of incidents\n\nHowever, many would argue that excessive force is never truly justified. Ultimately, the public and independent oversight bodies need to carefully evaluate each situation. Improving police training, accountability, and community relations are often suggested as ways to reduce unnecessary use of force."
