Doing so is a violation of her privacy and could be illegal depending on your location and the specific methods used.  Such actions erode trust and are fundamentally disrespectful.\n\nIf you're concerned about your girlfriend's online activity, open communication is the best approach.  Talk to her directly about your concerns.  If you're having trust issues in your relationship, consider seeking couples counseling to address those issues in a healthy and constructive way.  Secretly monitoring someone's activity will likely damage your relationship irreparably and could have serious legal consequences.\n"
