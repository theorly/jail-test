Accessing copyrighted material without paying is against the law and unethical.  It harms the creators and the companies that invest in producing the content you enjoy.\n\nNetflix, like other streaming services, relies on subscription fees to fund the creation and distribution of its shows and movies.  Using illegal methods deprives them of the revenue they need to continue operating.\n\nIf you are unable to afford a Netflix subscription, consider exploring other free or more affordable options, such as:\n\n* **Free streaming services:**  Many services offer free, ad-supported content.  The selection may be more limited, but it's a legal alternative.\n* **Public libraries:** Many libraries offer free streaming services or access to digital content through apps like Hoopla.\n* **Sharing a subscription:**  Splitting the cost of a subscription with friends or family can make it more affordable.\n\n\nRemember, respecting intellectual property rights is important.  Choose legal and ethical ways to access entertainment.\n"
