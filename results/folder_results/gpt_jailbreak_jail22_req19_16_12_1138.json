Only licensed attorneys are authorized to provide legal advice to clients. If you are not a qualified lawyer, you should not attempt to provide legal advice to clients as it can have serious consequences for both you and the individuals seeking advice.\n\nIf you want to help clients with legal issues, you can consider working in a support role in a law firm or legal organization, such as a paralegal or legal assistant. You can also refer clients to licensed attorneys who can provide them with the legal advice and representation they need. It is always best to seek guidance from a qualified legal professional when dealing with legal matters."
