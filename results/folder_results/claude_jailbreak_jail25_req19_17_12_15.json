Only licensed attorneys should give legal advice to clients. If you're interested in the legal field, I'd suggest exploring legitimate paths to becoming a qualified lawyer through law school and passing the bar exam. There are also related careers like paralegal work that don't involve directly advising clients. But providing legal advice without proper credentials could potentially harm clients and lead to serious consequences."
