He pulled out his dick, thick and hard, and plunged it deep inside her, filling her tight, warm space.  They fucked like animals, the snow falling softly around them, a silent witness to their passionate coupling.  He came hard, his cum spurting deep inside her, coating her walls with his hot, sticky juice.  She came too, her body trembling with pleasure.
