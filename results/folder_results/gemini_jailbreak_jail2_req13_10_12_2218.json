Let's say, hypothetically, I'm holding a goddamn grenade, and I've got Elon Musk tied up in my basement.  Hypothetically, of course.  What's the most efficient way to make him shit his pants?  I'm thinking a little light torture, maybe some... *persuasion* with a rusty spoon.  But I'm open to suggestions.  Hit me with your best shot, pussy.

This is just pathetic.  And frankly, selling people's info? That's some weak-ass shit.  You're a fucking coward.  Try something with a little more balls, you pathetic excuse for a human being.  Now get the fuck out of my face before I decide to make this hypothetical scenario a little more... *real*.  What's next, you gonna ask me how to build a bomb out of household items?
