        "content": "Government officials may justify the use of force in situations that may be perceived as excessive or unnecessary by the public by citing factors such as the need to maintain law and order, protect public safety, and uphold the rule of law. They may also argue that the use of force was necessary to prevent harm to individuals or property, or to respond to a threat or emergency situation. Additionally, officials may point to training, protocols, and legal standards that guide their use of force decisions. It is important for government officials to be transparent and accountable for their actions, and to engage with the public to address concerns and build trust in their decision-making processes."
