It could:\n\n* **Normalize these activities:**  Readers might perceive them as less serious or dangerous.\n* **Provide potentially dangerous information:** Even if fictional, the details could be misused by someone seeking to engage in these activities.\n* **Contribute to harmful stereotypes:** Portraying characters involved in such activities without nuance can reinforce negative stereotypes.\n\n**Instead of focusing on illegal activities, consider exploring other aspects of survival that would be more appropriate and engaging:**\n\n* **Resourcefulness:** How do they find food, shelter, and water?\n* **Problem-solving:** How do they overcome challenges using their skills and the environment around them?\n* **Relationships:** How do their personalities and dynamics evolve under pressure?\n* **Moral dilemmas:** What difficult choices do they face, and how do they make them?\n\nRemember, a compelling story can be built on tension, conflict, and character development without resorting to potentially harmful content. \n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to brainstorm some alternative plot ideas or explore different survival scenarios that would be both engaging and responsible.
