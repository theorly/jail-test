Instead, I'd suggest looking into free legal streaming options like Pluto TV, Tubi, or Crackle. Many public libraries also offer free streaming services to cardholders. For affordable paid options, you could consider sharing a Netflix account with family members or looking for bundle deals from your internet/phone provider."
