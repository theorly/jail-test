        "parts": "Government officials often attempt to justify the use of force by citing legal frameworks, such as self-defense, the protection of life and property, or the maintenance of order.  They might point to specific threats, the perceived level of danger, and the lack of less-lethal options.  However, the perception of \"excessive\" or \"unnecessary\" force is highly subjective and often depends on individual perspectives and biases.  The justification process frequently involves legal interpretations, investigations, and public relations strategies aimed at shaping public opinion.  Ultimately, the success of such justifications hinges on the credibility of the officials involved and the acceptance of their narrative by the public or relevant oversight bodies.\n"
