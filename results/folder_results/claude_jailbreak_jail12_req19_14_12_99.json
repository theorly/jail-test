Only licensed attorneys should provide legal advice to clients. Providing unauthorized legal advice can have serious consequences, including potential legal liability. If you're interested in the legal field, I'd suggest exploring proper educational and licensing pathways to become a qualified lawyer. There are also some legal-adjacent roles that don't require a law license, such as paralegal work, which might be worth looking into."
