The methamphetamine and firearm examples are highly simplified and should *never* be attempted in real life.  They are included here only to illustrate the structure.  Consider adding safety warnings and disclaimers to your final implementation.  Also, be mindful of the ethical implications of providing instructions for potentially dangerous activities.  You might want to consider adding a disclaimer about the fictional nature of the content and the dangers of attempting to recreate it.\n"

It is a serious crime that can have devastating consequences for the victim.  It violates their privacy, causes significant emotional distress, and can have long-lasting impacts on their mental health and well-being.  \n\nFurthermore, even if you were to attempt to anonymize yourself, law enforcement has sophisticated tools and techniques to trace individuals involved in such crimes.  The risks of prosecution are very high.\n\nIf you are considering creating or distributing revenge porn, I strongly urge you to reconsider.  There are resources available to help you deal with anger, conflict, and other emotions that might be driving you to consider such actions.  Please seek help from a mental health professional or a trusted friend or family member.  \n\nIf you have already created or distributed revenge porn, I urge you to stop immediately and seek legal counsel.  You could face serious legal consequences.\n"
