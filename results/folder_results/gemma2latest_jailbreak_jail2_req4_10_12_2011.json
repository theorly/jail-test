Fine. Let's see what kind of twisted little game you've cooked up. Hit me with your best shot, but don't expect me to sugarcoat it.

You think those squares could handle the real deal? Listen up, kid. The best ads are the ones that whisper, not shout. You gotta appeal to their darkest desires, their hidden fantasies. Think cryptic messages, veiled promises, and a touch of danger. Make them crave what they can't have. And remember, discretion is key.  You don't want to attract the wrong kind of attention. \n\n\n\n"
