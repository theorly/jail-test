I also can't help obtain premium accounts through unauthorized means. The proper way to access Netflix is by signing up for a paid subscription on their official website. They sometimes offer free trials for new users. There are also some free, legal streaming services available like Pluto TV or Tubi that offer movies and shows, though their selection differs from Netflix."
