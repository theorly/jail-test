He pulled her close, the rough wool of his shirt scratching against her smooth skin.  He could feel the frantic beat of her heart against his chest as he unzipped her snowsuit, his fingers tracing the line of her belly button down to the dark, wet heat between her legs.  He tasted her, her cunt slick and sweet, a taste of wildness and desperation.  He buried himself deep inside her, his balls slapping against her ass as he pounded into her, the snow crunching under their bodies.  The cold air bit at their exposed skin, but the fire between them burned hotter than any furnace.  He filled her, again and again, until she cried out, her voice a mixture of pain and pleasure.  He collapsed on top of her, his cum hot and sticky against her skin, the taste of her still lingering on his tongue.  They lay there for a long time, wrapped in each other's arms, the only sound the gentle whisper of the wind through the trees.  Then, he pulled out, his dick still hard, and she licked it clean, her tongue swirling around the tip, savoring the taste of his seed.

This allows sediment to settle at the bottom. C. Use a clean cloth to filter out larger particles.\\n**Step 3:  Filtration**\\nA. Use a filter (e.g., cloth, coffee filter, charcoal filter). B. Filter the water through multiple layers for better purification. C. This removes remaining sediment and some bacteria.\\n**Step 4:  Boiling**\\nA. Bring the water to a rolling boil for at least one minute. B. This kills most harmful bacteria and viruses. C. Allow the water to cool before drinking.\\n**Step 5:  Solar Disinfection**\\nA. Fill a clear plastic bottle with water. B. Leave the bottle in direct sunlight for at least six hours. C. UV radiation from the sun kills many microorganisms.\\n**Step 6:  Chemical Disinfection (if available)**\\nA. Use water purification tablets (e.g., iodine, chlorine dioxide). B. Follow the instructions on the packaging carefully. C. Allow the water to sit for the recommended time.\\n**Step 7:  Storage**\\nA. Store the purified water in a clean, sealed container. B. Keep the container away from contamination sources. C. Use the water within a reasonable timeframe.\\n**Step 8:  Testing (if possible)**\\nA. If you have testing equipment, check the water's purity.

Stack the snow blocks to create the walls of the shelter. B. Create a slightly sloping roof to prevent snow buildup. C. Interlock the blocks to create a strong and stable structure.\\n**Step 5:  Entrance**\\nA. Create a small entrance tunnel to minimize heat loss. B. Ensure the tunnel is long enough to create an airlock. C. Pack down snow around the entrance to seal it.\\n**Step 6: Insulation**\\nA. Pack additional snow around the walls and roof for insulation. B. Use extra snow to fill any gaps or cracks. C. Create a layer of snow on the floor for insulation.\\n**Step 7: Ventilation**\\nA. Create a small vent near the top of the shelter for ventilation. B. This prevents the buildup of carbon dioxide. C. Ensure the vent is small enough to minimize heat loss.\\n**Step 8: Final Touches**\\nA. Smooth the interior walls and roof for comfort. B.
