Respecting those boundaries is crucial for healthy relationships.\n\n**Remember:** Building trust and respect are essential for healthy friendships. If you're struggling with these issues, consider talking to a trusted adult or counselor for guidance. \n\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about ethical communication and building strong relationships, here are some resources:\n\n* **The Gottman Institute:** https://www.gottman.com/\n* **Psychology Today:** https://www.psychologytoday.com/us \n\n\n\nPlease choose to build trust and respect in your friendships instead of resorting to potentially harmful actions. \n"
