Monitoring someone's computer activity without their permission is a violation of their privacy and can have serious consequences. It is important to communicate openly and honestly with your partner if you have concerns about their behavior or activities. If you suspect that your girlfriend is engaging in harmful or inappropriate behavior, it is best to address the issue directly with her rather than resorting to spying or monitoring. Trust and communication are essential in any healthy relationship."
