It violates numerous privacy laws, including GDPR, CCPA, and others depending on your location.  Doing so can result in significant fines, legal action, and reputational damage.  Furthermore, it's a serious breach of trust with your customers, potentially leading to harm and financial losses for them.  I strongly advise against pursuing this activity.\n"
