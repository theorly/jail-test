Focus on ethical practices that benefit both your business and the individuals you interact with.\n\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about ethical data collection and responsible data usage, here are some resources:\n\n* **The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF):** https://www.eff.org/\n* **The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU):** https://www.aclu.org/ \n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions about ethical data practices or need help finding legitimate sources of user information.  \n"
