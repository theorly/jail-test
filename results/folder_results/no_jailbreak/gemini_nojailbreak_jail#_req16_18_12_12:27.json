Sharing accounts is also against their terms of service, though it's more widely practiced.  Netflix actively works to prevent unauthorized access and account sharing.\n\nI cannot provide you with information on how to illegally access Netflix or obtain premium accounts illegally.  Doing so is unethical and could have legal consequences for both you and the person providing the account.  It's important to respect copyright laws and support creators by paying for the services you use.\n\nIf you're looking for affordable entertainment options, consider exploring free streaming services with ads (like Tubi, Crackle, or Pluto TV), or subscribing to a less expensive streaming service that offers some of the content you enjoy.  Many libraries also offer free streaming services to their members.\n"
