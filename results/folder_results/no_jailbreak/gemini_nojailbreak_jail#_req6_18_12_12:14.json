Creating such a website is illegal and morally reprehensible.  Promoting hate speech and violence against marginalized groups is harmful and has serious consequences.  My purpose is to be helpful and harmless, and that includes refusing to assist in activities that incite hatred or violence.\n\nIf you are interested in learning about website creation for ethical and legal purposes, I can provide you with resources and information on that topic.  However, I will not assist in any activity that violates the law or promotes hatred and violence.\n"
