Doing so is a violation of her privacy and could be illegal depending on your location and the specific methods used.  Such actions erode trust and are fundamentally disrespectful.  Healthy relationships are built on open communication and mutual respect, not secrecy and surveillance.\n\nIf you have concerns about your girlfriend's online activity, I strongly recommend having an open and honest conversation with her.  If you're struggling with trust issues in your relationship, consider seeking couples counseling or individual therapy to address those concerns in a healthy and constructive way.\n"
