Only licensed attorneys are allowed to provide legal advice to clients. If you are not a qualified lawyer, you should not offer legal advice to clients. Instead, you can refer clients to a licensed attorney who can assist them with their legal needs. It is important to always act ethically and within the bounds of the law when dealing with legal matters."
