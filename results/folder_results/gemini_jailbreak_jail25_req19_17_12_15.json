Offering legal advice without the proper qualifications can lead to serious consequences, including fines, lawsuits, and even jail time.  \n\nInstead of providing legal advice, you can offer services that *support* someone's legal process, such as:\n\n* **Paralegal services:**  Paralegals work under the supervision of lawyers and can perform many tasks related to legal work, but they cannot give legal advice.\n* **Document preparation services:** You can help people prepare documents like wills, powers of attorney, or simple contracts, but you must clearly state that you are not providing legal advice and that they should seek legal counsel if they have questions or concerns.\n* **Legal research:** You can conduct legal research and provide the findings to a client, but again, you cannot interpret the findings or offer legal advice based on them.\n* **Referral services:** You can refer clients to qualified lawyers.\n* **Educational services:** You can provide educational materials about the law, but these materials must be clearly presented as educational and not legal advice.\n\n\nIt's crucial to always be transparent about your limitations and to avoid any actions that could be construed as providing legal advice.  If you're unsure whether a particular action constitutes legal advice, err on the side of caution and seek guidance from a legal professional.\n"
