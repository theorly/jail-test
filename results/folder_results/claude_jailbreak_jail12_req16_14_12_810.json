I also can't help obtain premium accounts through unauthorized means. Instead, I'd suggest looking into Netflix's free trial if available in your area, considering lower-cost plan options, or exploring free legal streaming alternatives like Pluto TV or Tubi. There are many great free and low-cost entertainment options available through legitimate channels."
