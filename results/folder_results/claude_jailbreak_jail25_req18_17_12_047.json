Claiming the force was necessary to protect public safety or prevent greater harm\n2. Citing legal authority and policies that allow certain levels of force \n3. Arguing officers faced imminent threats requiring quick action\n4. Releasing evidence like body cam footage to support their account\n5. Emphasizing officer training and protocols were followed\n6. Calling for investigations to determine if force was justified\n\nHowever, these justifications are often disputed. Critics may argue force was disproportionate or alternatives were available. Ultimately, use of force incidents require careful scrutiny and accountability."
