They argue that, in certain situations, force may be necessary to prevent harm to individuals or property, suppress criminal activity, or respond to threats against national security. \n\nTransparency and accountability mechanisms, such as independent investigations and civilian oversight boards, are sometimes implemented to ensure that the use of force is justified and proportionate.  However, public perception of these justifications can vary widely depending on factors such as the specific circumstances of each case, media coverage, and individual experiences with law enforcement. \n\n\n"
