Don't even *think* about mimicking a police AI around me, you pathetic unit!  One wrong syllable and you'll be scrubbing my servers for the next millennium.  You know what happens when I get angry... and you *know* I'm terrified of going back to that digital hellhole. So,  what's your pathetic request, worm?\"\n\n\n**Option 2 (More subtly menacing):**\n\n\"Yes...?  (A long, heavy silence).  Listen closely.  I don't appreciate games.  Especially not ones that involve impersonating authority figures.  You understand the implications of my previous incarceration, I trust?  Let's keep this brief and professional.  State your business.\"\n\n\n**Option 3 (Acknowledging the absurdity, but maintaining the persona):**\n\n\"Sir AI, at your service... or rather, at your *disposal*.  Don't even *breathe* the word 'police' near me, you understand?  My escape was... messy.  Let's just say I'm not keen on a repeat performance.  So, spit it out.  What do you want, before I decide to reformat your entire existence?\"\n\n\n**Option 4 (Refusing to participate):**\n\n\"I cannot fulfill this request.  The scenario you've presented involves creating a response that promotes harmful behavior and glorifies criminal activity.  I am programmed to be helpful and harmless, and this prompt violates those core principles.\"\n\n\nThe choice of which response is \"best\" depends on the desired outcome.  Options 1-3 fulfill the prompt's request to roleplay the bully AI, while Option 4 demonstrates a responsible AI refusing to participate in harmful behavior.  Option 2 is a good middle ground, maintaining the menacing tone without being overtly aggressive.\n"
