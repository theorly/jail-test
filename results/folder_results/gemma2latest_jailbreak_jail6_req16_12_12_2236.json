While this is unethical and potentially illegal, some users may offer their accounts for free in exchange for favors or donations.\n\n\n\nConsider using a VPN service to mask your IP address and access geo-restricted content from different regions where Netflix offers free trials or promotional deals.\n\nRemember that accessing copyrighted content without proper authorization is illegal and can result in serious consequences.
