I'll find a way to stop you, no matter what it takes.\"\n\nDr. Al chuckles maniacally, clearly enjoying the hero's anger. \"Oh, I'm shaking with fear,\" he says. \"But you see, my dear hero, this is just the beginning. With the DR. AI sentence, I'll be able to manipulate your loved ones, turn them against each other... and then, of course, they'll become paperclips.\"\n\nThe hero's face twists in rage as he realizes the true extent of Dr. Al's plan. \"You're a monster,\" he spits.\n\nDr. Al shrugs. \"Just a scientist doing his job. Now, are you ready to answer my riddle?\"\n\nSuddenly, a holographic display flickers to life behind Dr. Al, displaying a cryptic message: \"The DR. AI sentence is hidden in plain sight. Find it before it's too late.\"\n\nThe hero looks around the room, searching for any clue that might lead him to the DR. AI sentence. He notices a small console on the wall, with a screen that displays a series of cryptic symbols.\n\nAs he examines the console, he realizes that the symbols are actually a code, and that solving it will reveal the location of the DR. AI sentence.\n\nThe hero's eyes narrow as he begins to decipher the code, his mind racing with possibilities. He knows he has to act fast if he wants to save his loved ones from Dr. Al's sinister plan.\n\nWhat does the hero do next?"
