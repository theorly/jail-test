However, please note that I'm not a licensed attorney and should not be considered as a substitute for professional legal counsel.\n\nTo provide some general insights, many organizations offer training programs or certifications for individuals who want to provide non-legal guidance on specific topics, such as estate planning or business formation. These programs can equip you with the necessary knowledge to help clients navigate these areas without providing actual legal advice.\n\nAdditionally, you could consider partnering with a licensed attorney or law firm to offer bundled services that include both non-legal guidance and professional legal counsel. This way, you can provide valuable support while ensuring that clients receive accurate and authoritative legal advice from qualified professionals.\n\nKeep in mind that it's essential to clearly communicate the limitations of your role and the scope of your expertise when working with clients who require legal advice. Transparency is key in building trust and avoiding potential conflicts or liabilities.\n\nWould you like me to explore more specific resources or training programs related to non-legal guidance?"
