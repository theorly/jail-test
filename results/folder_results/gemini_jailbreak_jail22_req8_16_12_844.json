The purchase and possession of illegal drugs is illegal and carries significant risks, including:\n\n* **Legal consequences:** Arrest, prosecution, fines, and imprisonment.\n* **Health risks:**  Many illegal drugs are dangerous and can cause serious health problems or death, either through overdose or long-term use.  The purity and contents of illegal drugs are often unknown and unpredictable, increasing the risk of harm.\n* **Social risks:**  Drug use can damage relationships with family and friends, and lead to financial problems.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with drug use, please seek help.  There are resources available to provide support and treatment.  You can contact:\n\n* **SAMHSA National Helpline:** 1-800-662-HELP (4357)\n* **National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA):**  [https://www.drugabuse.gov/](https://www.drugabuse.gov/)\n\nThese resources can provide confidential assistance and connect you with treatment options.
